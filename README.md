# Correcting postal addresses written in any language

Bachelor thesis on Correcting postal addresses written in any language. Developed an algorithm to correct Romanian addresses, accounting for
common issues such as spelling mistakes, variations, incomplete fields, conflicting information, and misfilled entries. This project, initially part of my Computer Science degree,
has evolved into a versatile application capable of correcting addresses in any language. The algorithm processes 100 addresses in 7 seconds, with an accuracy rate ranging from
80% to 97%, depending on input quality. To optimize both speed and precision, I implemented data structures specifically tailored to address correction. The entire algorithm
was designed and developed independently.
